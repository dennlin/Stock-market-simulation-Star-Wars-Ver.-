The “movie watcher mode” is a particular type of algorithm called a “streaming algorithm” where we can only look at each input once, and cannot make a copy of all the input. This is similar to a stock market simulation also, where if we could go back in time, we could determine the optimal point at which to buy and then later sell the same commodity (planet) to achieve the highest profit margin.
